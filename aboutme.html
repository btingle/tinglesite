        About Me: Ben Tingle
    </h1>
    <p>
        My name is Benjamin Tingle, 25 years old. <br>
        My Quick Fact Sheet: Born and raised in the south bay, the first of three children, and I'm a scorpio. (in case you care for some reason)<br>
        <br>
        I attended college at SF State University, initially undeclared. After helping someone with their CS homework, I realized I had a real passion for the subject and enrolled as a computer science major. <br>
        That aptitude landed me an internship, and that internship soon became a full time job, whereupon I left my studies at SF State before finishing.<br>
        <br>
        For four years I worked at my CS job, which was initially exciting- I got to make a living doing something I loved doing!<br>
        Solving problems was fun, but the goal was too abstract- I could not determine what value my work had to the outside world.<br>
        So eventually I quit, and purely by chance I stumbled onto CNC machining- a more balanced mixture of abstract and real- which I fell in love with like I had CS all those years ago.<br>
        I've been hard at work developing my CNC/CAD/CAM/Machinist skills for over seven months and am looking for an environment where I can grow even more.
