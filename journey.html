        I got the design for the pieces from a 3D printing project I found online, and the engravings I converted from images I found online. CAM using the ancient free software that came packaged with the machine. Each face is CNC-engraved (not laser). Yes, it actually works (though not very smoothly). I learned the hard way on this project that fixturing tiny little pieces is quite difficult!

    <p>
        Quite a lot of time and effort went into this improvement- I had to come up with many entirely new processes and ideas to manufacture these tiny curved pieces to more exacting specifications. My CAD and CAM skills leveled up too. Off camera there was lots and lots of experimentation with making jigs.
        For a couple months I would spend up to 12 hours a day 6 days a week working on my projects in the shop and studying.

        My loop-de-loop project I haven't <i>quite</i> finished- an extension of my marble track project. I created a functional loop-de-loop that lacks some finishing touches. I had to get creative with my fixtures for this one! Who says rubber bands aren't sturdy enough? This was also my first foray into creating scripts for my own custom gcode! I don't have access to any fancy software, so I make my own!<br>
        <i>Behind the scenes, I spent a lot of time writing my own little custom CAM library, which I am continuously tweaking</i>

        I had some fun making this animation, which is my idea for a marble sculpture project, that I have made significant progress on already. I plan on optimizing the production time and accuracy even more with this track.

        Hose Clip Mold
    </h2>
    <p>
        This project was for practical purposes- I needed some plastic clips/straps for a home project, and decided it would be easy enough to mold them myself. In my design, I made sure to account for the thickness of the material I was pressing and to avoid any sharp angles.

        In preparation for a more ambitious project I have planned I wanted to make some upgrades to the bandsaw I use: giving it a fence, a miter slide, as well as some other specialty tools.

        This was a deeper dive into creating custom gcode- the free software I use approximates your mesh by tracing contours around it Z-level by Z-level, or X-level by X-level, etc, but never traces contours that combine motions from all axes, even though the machine has the capability.
        If your geometry follows a natural contour, it makes more sense for the gcode to follow that natural contour than to try and approximate it level by level.
        It is much more efficient, too- this quality of surface finish would have taken hours instead of minutes to achieve if the default gcode was used.

        CNC Workshop- Yin Yang Trays
    </h2>
    <p>
        I hosted a workshop for the CNC machine with four students, where each student would be guided through the steps of creating a project idea I had prepared in advance.
        The project was to create a set of matching yin-yang trays for holding miscellaneous small items.
        I showed by example how to perform each operation and explained its importance, and then let each student perform it themselves, correcting mistakes if need be and explaining what had gone wrong.
        Despite significant overtime due to some unexpectedly faulty tools, each student walked home satisfied with a completed project.
        The goal was to spark interest amongst the interested by providing a short but sweet example on what the machine is capable of doing.
